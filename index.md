# TOGAF Diagrams Library

This repository contains a curated set of clear and practical visual diagrams that illustrate key concepts, phases, and structures of the TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) standard.

It is designed to support architects, analysts, and students who want to understand or communicate TOGAF using a set of self-contained, high-quality reference visuals.

## Diagrams Overview

### 1. **TOGAF ADM Cycle Diagram**

**Purpose**: Shows the Architecture Development Method (ADM) lifecycle with all phases (Preliminary, A‚ÄìH, Requirements).

* Visually highlights flow and iteration.
* Ideal for introducing the entire TOGAF process.

### 2. **Enterprise Continuum & Architecture Repository**

**Purpose**: Explains the relationship between architecture types and solution types.

* Highlights how assets evolve from generic to specific.
* Shows the architecture repository as a storage/governance structure.

### 3. **Capability Assessment & Maturity Models**

**Purpose**: Helps assess whether an organization is ready to conduct architecture work.

* Includes capability areas (skills, tools, governance).
* Provides visual scoring levels.

### 4. **Stakeholder Map with Views and Concerns**

**Purpose**: Match stakeholders to viewpoints and architectural concerns.

* Includes stakeholder roles.
* Maps each role to their key interests.

### 5. **Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) vs. Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)**

**Purpose**: Clarify the distinction and show how ABBs transform into SBBs.

* Shows abstract-to-concrete transition.
* Provides real-world examples (e.g., CRM, ETL tools).

### 6. **Architecture Content Framework**

**Purpose**: Illustrate the core elements of the TOGAF Content Metamodel.

* Shows deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks.
* Defines relationships between content types.

### 7. **Architecture Governance Model**

**Purpose**: Define governance structures and responsibilities.

* Includes architecture board, review processes, escalation flows.
* Adds governance KPIs and scope.
